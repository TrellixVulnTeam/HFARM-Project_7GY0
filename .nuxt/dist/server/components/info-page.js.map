Each profile can be deleted from the list by clicking on the trash button, or a related note can be viewed. <br><br>\\n      Respectively to the application position, there is a direct link to the application page, so you can view the status and other related applications.\\n      In the application page (Calls) you can see some identification cards, with some general information: if the application is internal or for an external customer (with name related to the customer) or if it is marked as preferred. <br>\\n      There is the possibility to delete, through <button class=\\\"button is-light is-small\\\"><img\"+(_vm._ssrAttr(\"src\",require(\"../assets/trash.svg\")))+\" width=\\\"15px\\\"></button>, the application, or to insert it among the favorites, clicking on <button class=\\\"button is-light is-small\\\"><img\"+(_vm._ssrAttr(\"src\",require(\"../assets/fav.svg\")))+\" width=\\\"15px\\\"></button>. <br>\\n      Cards can be filtered by customer category (internal, external) or searched by assigned name. <br><br>\\n      In order to create a new application, just select the first card used for the creation and a data entry page (form) will open where the name, the customer and the preference (if any) of the application will be entered. <br>\\n      Upon confirmation this will appear in the list together with the others.\\n    </p> <h3><span>#</span> Next steps (hypothesis)</h3> <p>\\n      Data, session and authorization management, as well as secure operation and privacy, can be managed via the Google authorization system (OAuth 2.0). <br>\\n      Each user could register with their google account and log in to the app. This way Google API could be used to access the file that contains the data. <br><br>\\n      The application could have new parameters such as: the start and end date (currently only simulated in a random way), so as to filter the application according to a specific month of expiration, or organizing them by priority. <br><br>\\n      Other possible implementations could concern candidates' profiles, with a dedicated page with much more personal information and/or scores assigned by recruiters.\\n    </p> <h3><span>#</span> Note</h3> <p>\\n      Given the initial brief, some graphics were rethought and new sections added, while integrating and maintaining the proposed components and user flow. <br>\\n      The application layout has been entirely thought and designed, using some good web design guidelines. <br><br>\\n      The project has been created and maintained in a personal <a href=\\\"https://github.com/danielcurcione/\\\">GitHub</a> repository, public and available. <br>\\n      To this repository has been implemented the automatic build &amp; deploy system of <a href=\\\"https://www.netlify.com/\\\">Netlify</a>, hosting system where the project is hosted. <br>\\n      This platform automatically updates the app based on the last change uploaded to the git repository. <br><br>\\n      The API used was purchased on a monthly, personal plan and allows for up to 200 requests (read, write, edit, delete) per month. <br>\\n      The app is then functional until the limit is reached. (For the entire development and testing, about 2,000 were used, using the paid plan).  <br><br></p></div>\")])}\nvar staticRenderFns = []\n\nexport { render, staticRenderFns }","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./InfoPage.vue?vue&type=template&id=73933359&\"\nvar script = {}\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  \"6095453c\"\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports"],"mappings":";;;;;;AAAA;;;;;;;ACAA;;;;;;;;;;;;ACAA;AACA;AACA;;;;;;;;ACFA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
